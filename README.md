# Tris Server

This program provides both server and client of a tris server, which supports a Player-vs-Player mode and a Player-vs-AI mode.  
The IA uses the same algorithm as [this repository](https://github.com/Achille004/Tris) on my personal account.


To play it, you first have to start the server and then the client(s).  
The examples on how to run both server and client are at the bottom of the [main file](https://github.com/Achille004-School/Tris-Server/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/Main.kt).
